## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information Collected Directly by the App

**Network Watch does not collect any personal information directly.**

All data you enter in the App (website URLs, IP addresses, MAC addresses, etc.) is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.

### 2.2 iCloud Sync

If you enable iCloud sync, your app data is stored in your personal iCloud account. This data is managed according to Apple's Privacy Policy.

### 2.3 Information Collected Through Third-Party Services

#### Google AdMob (Advertising)

The App displays advertisements through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect the following information:

- Device identifiers (Advertising ID/IDFA)
- IP address
- Device information (model, OS version)
- Ad interaction data

For more details, please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

#### App Tracking Transparency (ATT)

On iOS 14.5 and later, the App requests your consent before tracking. You can deny this request, and if denied, generic ads will be shown instead of personalized ads.

#### IP Geolocation Service

When using the IP geolocation feature, the IP address you enter is sent to ip-api.com service. This is the IP address you input, not your personal IP address.
